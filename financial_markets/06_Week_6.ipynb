    "- Investment banks and money managers and their influences\n",
    "- Commercial banks take deposits and make loans\n",
    "- Investment banks don't accept deposits and don't make loans, but they underwrite securities\n",
    "    - Companies go to investment banks when they need money\n",
    "    - Investment banks issue new shares for those companies or issue debt: that is underwriting securities\n",
    "    - Bulge-bracket firms (big firms): First Boston, Goldman Sachs (since the 2008 crisis it's a commercial bank), Merril Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers (bankrupt after 2008)\n",
    "- Finance is about making things happen: you need finance to do or build good things\n",

    "- Underwriting securities = issuance of shares and corporate debt\n",

    "- If we want to issue new shares, investment banks examine us and certify the issue\n",
    "- Moral Hazard problem mitigated by investment banks\n",
    "    - Firms might want to issue new shares when they know that the high earnings are only temporarily high\n",
    "    - Investment banks deal with those types of issues\n",
    "    - Studies show that investment banks that repeatedly underprice or overprice issues suffer a market share loss afterwards\n",
    "        - Low price is bad for the company\n",
    "        - High price is bad for the new investors\n",
    "- Investment banks have many contacts and are necessary for issuing new shares; they are like an authority, without them, people won't trust you\n",
    "- The underwriting process\n",
    "    - There are several phases\n",
    "    - It is based on trust; many people in each step don't read really all the documents\n",
    "    - If after issuing the price falls, the underwriter investment bank buys shares at the initial price: that's called stabilization, SEC agrees with it (it's not considered manipulation)\n",
    "    - Stabilization is done to prevent panicking and to deal with reputation issues"

    "- A company can trade shares privately\n",
    "- If they go public, they need to do it through the SEC and prepare an IPO\n",
    "- The SEC does not evalkuate if the shares are going to be sold; the SEC evaluates that there is no manipulation\n",
    "- Usually the price increases after the IPO: the underwriter underprices the shares - but the SEC does not intervine\n",
    "    - It is actually a manipulation, because the friends of the company get the shares cheaper\n",
    "    - That is how the world works\n",
    "    - Often, after the first day 15% increase can be observed; BUT: it could be that in one year the company is gone too!\n",

    "    - Underwriters offer cheap tickets and advertise the concert as if it were great\n",

    "    - They could increase the prices, but they don't so that the young people join! "

    "    - It turned out they became a great business, especially when derivatives appeared\n",
    "    - In the early 2000s the rating agencies were getting casual and unprofessional; that was one of the causes of the 2008 crisis: they gave good marks to bad companies/mortgages\n",

    "    - They redeemed on demand: the investors could get their money whenever they wanted!\n",

    "    - You contact the investment company and give a cheque with the money\n",
    "    - You don't buy shares, they do it for you\n",
    "    - They have a portfolio of shares\n",

    "    - They are more liquid than mutual funds, lower costs\n",
    "    - Mutual funds are called open-end funds\n",
    "        - Closed-end funds are something different: you buy your share on the fund, but you can't redeem them from the fund, you need to sell them in a market\n",
    "        - The advantage of closed-end funds is that they are traded all the time on the market, not at 4 pm at the Mutual Fund\n",
    "        - However, the price of the closed-fund share is not tied to the value of the assets hold by the fund! May the price of the share is lower than the assets, because they have a bad management and people don't trust them!\n",
    "    - The ETFs wre created as an alternative for open-end (= mutual funds) and closed-end funds\n",
    "    - The idea is you have\n",
    "        - Like an  open-end fund\n",

    "        - The fund tracks the value of the underlying assets\n",
    "    - ETFs are groups of company shares that have the certificate of being traded in the ETF basket\n",
    "        - The ETF itself has a share value, which follows the prices of the underlying assets, but it sometimes deviates a little bit\n",

    "        - At premium, when price of ETF higher than the assets\n",

    "### Brokers and Dealers\n",
    "- A broker is someone who acts on behalf of another one, agent which can earn a comission\n",
    "- A dealer always acts for himself; if contact a dealer, the dealer owns the stocks and he sells them to us at a price, there is no comission; we can sell to a dealer\n",
    "    - It is analogous to an antique dealer\n",
    "    - The dealers usually have higher costs, that's why often it's more expensive treating with them\n",
    "- A broker-dealer is a firm doing business both as broker and as dealer; it must be registered\n",
    "    - A person cannot be both, broker and dealer, on the same transaction\n",

    "    - It is illegal to make too many transactions that yield more comissions; that's called churning\n",
