    "### Investment Banks Introduction\n",
    "- Investment banks and money managers and their influences\n",
    "- Commercial banks take deposits and make loans\n",
    "- Investment banks don't accept deposits and don't make loans, but they underwrite securities\n",
    "    - Companies go to investment banks when they need money\n",
    "    - Investment banks issue new shares for those companies or issue debt: that is underwriting securities\n",
    "    - Bulge-bracket firms (big firms): First Boston, Goldman Sachs (since the 2008 crisis it's a commercial bank), Merril Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers (bankrupt after 2008)\n",
    "- Finance is about making things happen: you need finance to do or build good things\n",

    "### Underwriting Securities\n",
    "- Underwriting securities = issuance of shares and corporate debt\n",
    "- Investment banks have researchers and know where the money is; in that sense, companies could get advise from them\n",
    "- If we want to issue new shares, investment banks examine us and certify the issue\n",
    "- Moral Hazard problem mitigated by investment banks\n",
    "    - Firms might want to issue new shares when they know that the high earnings are only temporarily high\n",
    "    - Investment banks deal with those types of issues\n",
    "    - Studies show that investment banks that repeatedly underprice or overprice issues suffer a market share loss afterwards\n",
    "        - Low price is bad for the company\n",
    "        - High price is bad for the new investors\n",
    "- Investment banks have many contacts and are necessary for issuing new shares; they are like an authority, without them, people won't trust you\n",
    "- The underwriting process\n",
    "    - There are several phases\n",
    "    - It is based on trust; many people in each step don't read really all the documents\n",
    "    - If after issuing the price falls, the underwriter investment bank buys shares at the initial price: that's called stabilization, SEC agrees with it (it's not considered manipulation)\n",
    "    - Stabilization is done to prevent panicking and to deal with reputation issues"

    "### Initial Public Offerings = IPOs\n",
    "- A company can trade shares privately\n",
    "- If they go public, they need to do it through the SEC and prepare an IPO\n",
    "- The SEC does not evalkuate if the shares are going to be sold; the SEC evaluates that there is no manipulation\n",
    "- Usually the price increases after the IPO: the underwriter underprices the shares - but the SEC does not intervine\n",
    "    - It is actually a manipulation, because the friends of the company get the shares cheaper\n",
    "    - That is how the world works\n",
    "    - Often, after the first day 15% increase can be observed; BUT: it could be that in one year the company is gone too!\n",
    "- The Concert analogy (Impressario hypothesis)\n",
    "    - Underwriters offer cheap tickets and advertise the concert as if it were great\n",
    "    - Then, the young excited people join to the concert\n",
    "    - They could increase the prices, but they don't so that the young people join! "

    "- An alternative to an investmenmt bank in terms of trust would be a rating agency\n",
    "- A rating agency publishes its information, in contrast to an investment bank\n",
    "- First rating agency: Mooddy's (1909); he decided to give ratings like at school\n",
    "    - Best rating is AAA\n",
    "    - Rating agencies did not accept money at the begining; but in the 1970 they started charging\n",
    "    - They still accept money for their ratings, but that is unethical and it should be regulated and banned!\n",
    "    - It turned out they became a great business, especially when derivatives appeared\n",
    "    - In the early 2000s the rating agencies were getting casual and unprofessional; that was one of the causes of the 2008 crisis: they gave good marks to bad companies/mortgages\n",
    "    - Now they have lost their reputation, but they still continue, and they are more carefully observed"
