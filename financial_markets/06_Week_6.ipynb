    "### Investment Banks Introduction\n",
    "- Investment banks and money managers and their influences\n",
    "- Commercial banks take deposits and make loans\n",
    "- Investment banks don't accept deposits and don't make loans, but they underwrite securities\n",
    "    - Companies go to investment banks when they need money\n",
    "    - Investment banks issue new shares for those companies or issue debt: that is underwriting securities\n",
    "    - Bulge-bracket firms (big firms): First Boston, Goldman Sachs (since the 2008 crisis it's a commercial bank), Merril Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers (bankrupt after 2008)\n",
    "- Finance is about making things happen: you need finance to do or build good things\n",
    "    - Shiller sees investment very positively, although people distrust investment banks\n",
    "    - Shiller thinks the large economical growth we've seen is due to financial capitalism"

    "### Underwriting Securities\n",
    "- Underwriting securities = issuance of shares and corporate debt\n",
    "- Investment banks have researchers and know where the money is; in that sense, companies could get advise from them\n",
    "- If we want to issue new shares, investment banks examine us and certify the issue\n",
    "- Moral Hazard problem mitigated by investment banks\n",
    "    - Firms might want to issue new shares when they know that the high earnings are only temporarily high\n",
    "    - Investment banks deal with those types of issues\n",
    "    - Studies show that investment banks that repeatedly underprice or overprice issues suffer a market share loss afterwards\n",
    "        - Low price is bad for the company\n",
    "        - High price is bad for the new investors\n",
    "- Investment banks have many contacts and are necessary for issuing new shares; they are like an authority, without them, people won't trust you\n",
    "- The underwriting process\n",
    "    - There are several phases\n",
    "    - It is based on trust; many people in each step don't read really all the documents\n",
    "    - If after issuing the price falls, the underwriter investment bank buys shares at the initial price: that's called stabilization, SEC agrees with it (it's not considered manipulation)\n",
    "    - Stabilization is done to prevent panicking and to deal with reputation issues"

    "### Initial Public Offerings = IPOs\n",
    "- A company can trade shares privately\n",
    "- If they go public, they need to do it through the SEC and prepare an IPO\n",
    "- The SEC does not evalkuate if the shares are going to be sold; the SEC evaluates that there is no manipulation\n",
    "- Usually the price increases after the IPO: the underwriter underprices the shares - but the SEC does not intervine\n",
    "    - It is actually a manipulation, because the friends of the company get the shares cheaper\n",
    "    - That is how the world works\n",
    "    - Often, after the first day 15% increase can be observed; BUT: it could be that in one year the company is gone too!\n",
    "- The Concert analogy (Impressario hypothesis)\n",
    "    - Underwriters offer cheap tickets and advertise the concert as if it were great\n",
    "    - Then, the young excited people join to the concert\n",
    "    - They could increase the prices, but they don't so that the young people join! "

    "- A rating agency publishes its information, in contrast to an investment bank\n",
    "- First rating agency: Mooddy's (1909); he decided to give ratings like at school\n",
    "    - Best rating is AAA\n",
    "    - Rating agencies did not accept money at the begining; but in the 1970 they started charging\n",
    "    - They still accept money for their ratings, but that is unethical and it should be regulated and banned!\n",
    "    - It turned out they became a great business, especially when derivatives appeared\n",
    "    - In the early 2000s the rating agencies were getting casual and unprofessional; that was one of the causes of the 2008 crisis: they gave good marks to bad companies/mortgages\n",
    "    - Now they have lost their reputation, but they still continue, and they are more carefully observed"

    "        - One problem of financial advise is that it's expensive; Shiller thinks there should be government subsidies for financial advisors, or philantropic support\n",
    "    - Low-income people need financial advise, because they are atargeted with false information, for instance, to buy a house witha mortgage\n",
    "        - It's not that they need stock portfolio management, but they need some coaching, like a therapist, to know how to save for the future\n",

    "### Mutual Funds and ETFs (Exchange Trade Funds)\n",
    "- Mutual Funds were invented in Holland in th 1770s, like many financial things\n",
    "- One of the pioneers in USA was the Massachusets Investment Trust (MIT, but no connection to the MIT university)\n",
    "    - They published their portfolio, in contrast to whatÂ´s done today in 1920\n",
    "    - They only had one class of investors or shares; many contemporary funds were playing tricks with class A & B shares\n",
    "    - They redeemed on demand: the investors could get their money whenever they wanted!\n",
    "    - MIT became the model for funds and investment management\n",
    "    - In the 1930s and 1940s everything was formally regulated\n",
    "- Mutual Funds: what are they and how do they work\n",
    "    - You contact the investment company and give a cheque with the money\n",
    "    - You don't buy shares, they do it for you\n",
    "    - They have a portfolio of shares\n",
    "    - When you give them money, you end up having a share of that portfolio, after subtracting the expenses (fees, salaries, etc.)\n",
    "    - When can call them and tell them we want to sell our share whenever we want to exit ang get our money\n",
    "    - They operate with closing prices: the closing (4 pm) prices of cheque in or exit is used\n",
    "- ETF = Exchange Trade Fund\n",
    "    - Something similar to the mutual funds\n",
    "    - Invented in the 1990s\n",
    "        - First ETF: Standard & Poor Depositary Receipts: they had a S&P500 portfolio\n",
    "    - They are more liquid than mutual funds, lower costs\n",
    "    - Mutual funds are called open-end funds\n",
    "        - Closed-end funds are something different: you buy your share on the fund, but you can't redeem them from the fund, you need to sell them in a market\n",
    "        - The advantage of closed-end funds is that they are traded all the time on the market, not at 4 pm at the Mutual Fund\n",
    "        - However, the price of the closed-fund share is not tied to the value of the assets hold by the fund! May the price of the share is lower than the assets, because they have a bad management and people don't trust them!\n",
    "    - The ETFs wre created as an alternative for open-end (= mutual funds) and closed-end funds\n",
    "    - The idea is you have\n",
    "        - Like an  open-end fund\n",
    "        - You can sell whenever you want because it is traded on a exchange (not only a at 4 pm at the Mutual Fund company), so immediately redeemable\n",
    "        - The fund tracks the value of the underlying assets\n",
    "    - ETFs are groups of company shares that have the certificate of being traded in the ETF basket\n",
    "        - The ETF itself has a share value, which follows the prices of the underlying assets, but it sometimes deviates a little bit\n",
    "        - We say the ETF is trading at a discount, when its price is lower than the assets\n",
    "        - At premium, when price of ETF higher than the assets\n",
    "        - The difference between ETF price and asset price is used to sell back asset share to the investors or buy more asset shares; that process keeps the ETF price tied or tracking to the asset price!\n",
    "        - So ETFs achieve automatic creation and redemption of shares\n",
    "    - A lot of people own stocks through ETFs now\n",
