## Lesson 8: Bonds, Interest Rates, Inflation

### 1982 Savings Account
- There used to be ads for savings accounts everywhere with interests of around 7% interest per annum!
    - It was great, because it was insured by the government!
    - The term used to be 0 (time to keep money in the bank)
- We don't have these things anymore

### Federal Funds and Interest Rates
- Term = time you have to leave your money in
- Shortest term is one day, but usually banks use it: people do not borrow money for just one day
- Diagraman of shortest-term interest rate for US shown: it was in 20% in the 80's, it's been almost 0% since the 2008 crisis
- Something very rare is happening; the Fed stablishes the interest rate
- It is forced to be 0 due to the crisis, because it stabilizes the economy -- why?
- EONIA: the European equivalent interest rate, has the same shape, it even becomes negative!
- It can be negative very long, because banks loose money: why should they lend money with negative interest rates: they'd be loosing; it is better to hold to the money than loosing it!
- So why do banks lend money with negative interest rates if they are loosing? Because it's costly keeping cash, although it sounds silly: you need to have vaults, guards, etc. These costs make negative interest rates possible
- Cause of interest rates; book by BÃ¶hm-Bawerk, 1884. He said that the interest rates reflect
    - the rate of progress
    - time preference: the lender wants the inflated value of lent money now
    - and roundaboutness: the promise of improving production
- Do low interest rates contribute to inequality?
    - There is some connection
    - Elderly people retire sometimes in hopes of living from interest rates, but these are 0, they live from savings

### Compound Interest
- If we have an interest rate of r which is compounded, the amount due to the interest increases exponentially: (1+r)^t
- Usually the compounding is done at the end of the year: we get the earnings due to interest and apply to it the interest rate
- However, it could be done several times a year: if we do it continuously, we get a series for which the limit is e^(rt)

### Discount Bonds
- Bonds are originally like coupons:
    - You used to buy one bond, eg for 100 USD
    - then, every 6 months or the time established, you could get the from the bank 1.50 USD for having the bond; the bond paper was clipped, so that you could not get that 1.50 USD more than once
    - when the bond arrived its maturity, you could get your 100 USD back
- Bonds can be from the government of corporate
- Discount bonds have no coupon: you buy at a discount: you buy the bond for 90 USD, and when you get your money, you get 100 USD
- Price of the discount bond
    - P = 1 / (1+r)^T
    - r: yield to maturity: compounding interest we get
    - T: years we have the bond
    - P: present value or price we get
    - But typically bonds pay interest twice a year: P = 1 / (1 + r/2)^(2T)
- Note that at the time of the video the interests are negative!! So it doesn't make sense to buy bonds...

### Present Discounted Value = PDV
- We can compute the PDV of anything
    - PDV of a dollar in one year: 1 / (1+r)
    - in n years: 1 / (1+r)^n
    - PDV of a stream of payments x_i

### Conventional Bonds Carry Coupons
- Another form of bonds
- It issued at par
- I don't understand...
- Just another present value formula with an additional term containing 100 as the principal

### Consol and Annuity Formulas
- Consol pays constant quantity x forever
    - Consols are originally from Britain, because they issued never ending bongs; they are still paying some of them!
- Growing consol pays x(1+g)^(t-1) in time t
    - That's basically like a rent
- Annuity pays x for time 1 to t
- Consol PDV: x/r
- Growing consol PDV = x / (r-g); assuming r>g
    - The current situation with 0 interest rates (r) is very puzzling, because we get infinite or negative present values
    - They way to interpret it is: long-term interest rates are bigger than zero, the current situation is short-term anomaly
- Annuity PDV: another formula
    - Like a consol but it stops after a peroid of time
    - Example: mortgage
- Bonds have a market price, which makes them risky, even though the promise of the government is fixed and trustable
- All these present value formulas are related to the Gordon-Myron formula at the end: the sum of a geometric series.
    - Note that the formula actually dates back to Bernoulli, 1600s

### Forward Rates
- Interest rates that can be taken in advance
- Supose in 2020 I expect to have 100 USD to invest in 2021, but I want the money back in 2022. Can I guarantee the interest rate on the 100 investement today?
- There is a formula

### Inflation and Interest Rates

- Nominal interest rates are usually not corrected for inflation
    - We need to correct the rate!
    - Reat interest rate: r_real = r_nominal (money) - i (inflation)
        - This formula is an approximation
    - So if we have nominal interest rate of 3% and the inflation is 3%, we have areal interest rate of 0: we earn nothing

### Indexed Bonds
- Bonds with coupons that are tied to inflation rates
- Great idea
- France recently issued Euro indexed bonds

### Leverage
- If a company borrows money to buy assets, we say that person is leveraging
    - It is riskier
    - If we buy stocks and they increase enough, we might pay the debt and earn money
    - If the stocks go down, we increase our debt
- China is a highly leveraged economy, which arises concerns
- Debt leads to bankruptcies, possible world crises
    - Bankruptcy means you don't have money to pay your debts
- Before the 2008 crisis, leverage became very high: banks were allowing people to get credits for 96% of the value of the house
    - Everyone was doing that
    - Actually, home prices were going up so fast, that you could make a lot of money
    - People had the perception that home prices don't fall -- but they do fall!
- Is debt inmoral?
    - It is not!
    - You need to borrow money for many reasons: house, health, etc.
    - Debt is a good thing, but not always well managed

### Irving Fisher: The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions
- The optimists are the ones that usually have debts, they are willing to take risks
    - The lenders are usually pessimistic
- If there is deflation, the inflation is negative
    - The optimists end up having less money, pessimists have more
    - That means, in a deflation/depression, the wealth is re-distributed to the non risk takers
    - That is probably the reason why deflation is avoided?
- The reality is that the CPI (consumer price index) really has a big effect in the re-distribution of the wealth, even though people are really not aware of it
- The last crisis (2008) didn't bring that much deflation
- Shiller thinks we should index debt to CPI, and we should have a unit of account coupled with the CPI, like Chile did with the Unidad

## Lesson 9: Stocks

### Market Capitalization by Country
- Market cap of markets shown and then expressed as GDP % of their countries
    - 2014: USA: 154% GDP, it had the largest %
    - After 2014 % values declined a bit, 2014 was th peak
- USA is very capitalistic, everything is traded
    - However, still many people don't own stocks
    - Shiller points out that in some cases it is better to rent a house and invest with a diversified portfolio in the stock market rather than buying a house
- In USA: housholds own a tangible value of 98 trillion: that's much more than stocks
    - Stocks amount to approximately 13 trillion
    - Real estate owned by housholds: 23 trillion

### The Corporation and Stocks
- From the Latin corpus = body
- Organization incorporated, ie., as an artificial person or body
- In ancient Rome they had corporations and stock markets!
    - Corporations were called publicani
    - The stock market was in the market
    - People could buy shares!
- Board of Directors
    - A for-profit corporation is managed by the board of director, which is chosen by the share holders: one shae, on vote
    - The board of directors select the CEO
    - In Germany, they have 2 boards
        - Aufsichtsrat: supervisory
        - Vorstand: management
- For-profit vs non-profit
    - For-profit corporations are owned by the shareholders; corporate profit taxes need to be payed
    - Non-profit corporations are not owned by anyone! The board is composed by alumni of interested groups that promote the organization after some idealistic principles
        - Profits are not distributed to the participants
        - Profits are kept in the company and are invested in the purpose
        - Non-profits do not pay taxes on profits
        - Sometimes non-profits have problems with money they accumulate; but usually, they channel the money to fulfill the purpose of the organization

### Shares and Dividends
- A company is divided in N shares; the we buy n; n/N is relevant
- Companies do regularly splits: they divide a share to fit some share prices that are attractive to the buyers
    - The target share value is 30 USD in many cases
    - However, splits are essentially meaningless
    - The board of director decides when to do the splits
    - After a 2 for 1 split, share holders automatically have double the shares and the share prices is halved.
- It is not possible to buy or own fraction of a share, thus, it might be sensible to actually do splits sometimes
    - Fractions of share exist though, if you own ETFs or the like
- The corporate charter of a company is its constitution; it defines the rules
- Dividends are distributions of earnings of the company to its shareholders
    - That's one of the most important reasons for buying company shares!
    - Most of the returns we get are dividends
    - Companies don't have to pay dividends really; young companies don't, older companies do, because it shows they have money
    - Share price decreases in value when a dividend is payed, because the company doesn't have the money anymore
    - Stock price fall because of quarter dividend pay is not bad!
        - Companies fear that and sometimes they don't pay dividends because of that
    - Some companies do not regularly pay dividends, some do it very regularly
        - It is psychological

### Common vs. Preferred Stock
- Equity = Common Stock = Stock
- Preferred stocks work like this: the company doesn't need to pay the dividends, but if the want to offer common stocks, they need to pay all dividends they have not -- ??
- After the 2008 crisis, USA bought many preferred stocks to bail companies out; why preferred stocks? because USA is not a socialist country: the government doesn't really want to own the companies, just bail them out

### Corporate Charter
- The constitution of the company
- The basic version stablishes that all shareholder are treated equally
- If dividends payed, each share gets the same -- that's where the word "equity" comes from: equal share
- The company can buy back shares instead of paying dividends, or they can issue new shares -- there's no law against that
- Several regulations have been made to improve or guarantee good governance in corporations, to make possible some kind of shareholder democracy
- There can be classes of shares: A has voting right, B doesn't
    - Zuckerberg has 28% of Facebook shares, but 57% of its voting shares

### Corporations Raise Money
- If not enough money available, how do companies get money, eg., for marketing campaings or buildinga new factory, etc?
- One way are retained earnings: earn enough money to do it
    - But that is usually slower
    - Additionally, many companies put their earnings into the future, so they don't accumulate enough extra money
- Another option: borrow money
    - Bank loans
    - You can issue debt: a corporate bond, which is sold by a broker
- Another option: issue new shares
    - When that happens, shares are diluted: if a person owns 10% of the shares, if new shares are issued, that person owns automatically less than 10%
    - It seems controversial, but most shareholders accept it, because new issuances bring a lot of money to the company

### Dilution
- When new shares are issued, we have a dilution
- Sometimes companies pay dividends in stock shares: that is tricky
    - Everybody gets new shares in proportion to their holdings, so everybody keeps owning the same fraction!
    - This can be well intentioned though: the company might be doing that in the hopes that the stock price won't fall

### Dividends: Yes or No?
- Typically young companies don't pay dividends
- Many NASCAQ companies don't pay dividends
- Not paying dividends comes from the internet revolution (dotcom era): shareholders used to refuse dividends because the companies needed to have money to move faster

### Share Repurchase
- When a firm buys its own shares in the market
- That's reverse of dilution
    - Therefore, this is like paying a dividend
- Since the financial crisis, many share repurchases have been made
    - People used to say companies were repurchasing because prices were low
    - But now they are higher, and companies still do that because of tax breaks: since people don't get money, they don't have to pay taxes!
        - In USA, the tax on capital gains is capped in 15%
- Older people prefer getting dividends
    - Many people in the USA retire with th eplan of living from interest rates and dividends

### Market Value: Price as PDV (Present Discount Value) of Expected Dividends
- What is the market value?
- Most of the earnings or returns that people have had in the stock market is in the form of dividends, not in form of capital gains (ie., share value increase)
    - Thus, we can apply the Gordon-Myron model: P = E/(r-g) <-> P/E = 1/(r-g)
        - P: Price
        - E: Earning
        - r: it is actually the r of the CAMP model: the expected return, modelled with the covariance of the market; high values mean higher covariance with market, riskier
        - g: growth ratio; higher vakues are typical for companies that have many patents or which are expected to grow
    - P/E: price-earnings ratio: price per share / dividends per share
        - A low P/E doesn't mean a stock is a bargain: it means earnings are forecasted to decrease (low g) or risk is high (high r)
        - P/E can be understood as the number of years in which you get your money back
            - P/E = 100 -> in 100 years we get our money back, that's very high!
            - P/E = 15 -> 15 years; that's a typical number
        - Another perspective is high P/E companies are growth companies, low P/E companies have less growth
- However, efficient markets theory denies any rule works other than simple diversification
    - Remember that the efficient makets theory is half the truth
- Value investing says: invest in low P/E
    - However, low P/E ratios are sometimes due to
        - Risky businesses: people don't want to invest in them
        - Poor earnings growth outlook: earnings are likely to fall, eg., railroad companies
            - However, railroads are here to stay! So maybe it makes sense investing in them; for instance, during the dot-com bubble it was more reasonable to invest in the forgotten railroads than in dot-coms
    - Value investing is for low P/E because it says that P/E companies are the forgotten ones
- Are stock markets the best investment?
    - Shiller: No, a diversified portfolio is the best investement
    - He has a questionnaire being asked to investors since 1980, which asks that among others
        - The % of investors who agree with the statement has the same shape as the stock market index, with a one year lag
        - Why does a timeless opinion vary along time and correlated with the value of the stock market? Behavioral economics is the theory to understand that

### Why and how do companies pay dividends?
- Companies can give money to their share holders in two major ways
    - Pay dividends: earnings are shared; however, taxes need to be payed
        - However, it is still done; it seems people don't think that much on taxes
        - That's one of the reasons Shiller thinks the efficient markets theory is not completely true
        - However, there is also a lot of smart money in themarkets, so it's not completely untrue
    - Buy back shares: amount of shares decreases; no taxes need to be payed
- Self-control theory of dividends: Shefrin & Statman
- Dividends are common among older investors
    - They plan to live from interest rates and dividends
    - Therefore, they don't want to touch the initial principal
    - This is some kind of irrational stubborn way of thinking, but it is common among older investors
- Dividend signaling
    - Some companies signal their worth with dividend yields, they want to show they have money
    - Problem: alternative signaling methods are cheaper tax-wise, for example repurchasing shares
    - College education is sometimes also signaling; life is full of signaling, we're trying to proof things by our commitments
- Litner model of dividends
    - Litner (Harvard Bisiness School) interviewed companies to see how they pay dividends
        - It was unusual interviewing people in the efficient markets era, in which the mainstream philosophy was to not interview people and trust the markets
    - Bottomline of what he discovered: when earnings jump high, dividend don't, but they gradually go up each quarter to reach the target earnings/dividend ratio
        - They do that to avoid decreasing divided money if there are less earnings in the next quarter
        - There is a simple formula for that
