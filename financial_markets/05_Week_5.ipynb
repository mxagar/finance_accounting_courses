    "    - Shiller thinks that studies have become like a kind of aristocracy or classes in the US and probably somewhere else\n",
    "    - So young people thinks they need to study and connect to important people; that drives prices up\n",

    "- The usual market is the the spot market: you deal with the object immediately\n",
    "- In forward and futures markets, we have contracts for future prices and deliveries in the future\n",
    "- However, these markets have a function!\n",
    "    - Grain traders, for instance, trade in those markets\n",

    "    - Grain trading is the origin of forward and futures markets\n",
    "- Which assets end up in future markets?\n",
    "    - It's difficult to answer that -- it's a trial and error\n",
    "    - How do we know that a party will be great? It's similar\n",

    "    - Example: rice farmer sells grain to a warehouse\n",
    "- Both sides are locked to the contract: they have no liquidity\n",
    "    - What if the farmer gets drunk and doesn't produce grain?\n",
    "    - For that reason, we have futures markets: the risk of not knowing the farmer vanishes\n",
    "- Forward contracts are traded Over-The-Counter (OTC): not in a centralized exchange, but through a network of dealers"

    "### Futures Contracts\n",
    "- Like a forward contract, but both parties deal with an exchange rather than with each other\n",
    "- Futures contracts rely on margin calls\n",
    "    - Margin calls happen when an investor borrows part of the money from a broker to invest in a portfolio; when the value of the portfolio decreases below a price, the investor receives a margin call from the broker -- the investir needs to either sell some assets or put more funds in the portfolio\n",
    "    - The futures contract works like that\n",
    "        - Future price is set\n",
    "        - Present price is monitored\n",
    "        - The buyer has a margin account with the settled money in it and can exit whenever he wants\n",
    "        - If price goes down, the margin account is decreased with the difference: the broker takes money from the account\n",
    "            - The buyer can be called if no money is in the margin account to be asked to put money in the margin account\n",
    "            - If there is no money, they sell\n",
    "        - If price goes up, the buyer is protected"
