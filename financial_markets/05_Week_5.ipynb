    "    - Margin calls happen when an investor borrows part of the money from a broker to invest in a portfolio; when the value of the portfolio decreases below a price, the investor receives a margin call from the broker -- the investir needs to either sell some assets or put more funds in the portfolio\n",
    "    - The futures contract works like that\n",

    "        - If price goes down, the margin account is decreased with the difference: the broker takes money from the account\n",
    "            - The buyer can be called if no money is in the margin account to be asked to put money in the margin account\n",
