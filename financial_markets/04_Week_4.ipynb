    "    - Interestingly, central banks have started recessions inverting the yield curve\n",

    "- In USA (2016) statistics\n",
    "    - 13.2T USD debt\n",
    "    - 48 million mortgaged homes, 10.3 underwater after the crisis: in 2012 the housing market bottomed: the value of the home was less than the value of the mortgage\n",
    "        - That caused the whole economy to go down, because people had negative earnings and stopped spending and investing\n",
    "        - That was so especially for the young home owners, who had basically their home, nothing else\n",
    "- In 1920s it was usual to have 5-year term loans (now, we have typically 30 years), so after 5 years the mortgage needed to be re-negotiated\n",
    "    - Many houeses were foreclosed after the 1929 crash, because people lost their jobs and couldn't re-negotiate their mortgages\n",
    "    - Roosevelt changed that in 1934\n",
    "        - They state took the risk using tax-payer money: the mortgages were insured by the state; if someone didn't pay, the state could do it\n",
    "        - 15-year terms became standard\n",
    "- When prices drop a lot, usually the chance of going up is higher: mean regression\n",
    "    - In some places, house price become lower than the construction cost; that means no more houses are built there\n",
    "    - If we know that the place is going to be re-populated and life is going to go back to the normal there, it's a good investment to buy a cheap house there, when the prices are below the construction cost\n",
    "- The interest rate of 30-year term mortgages and 10-year bond insterest rates are shwon in a graph from 1965 to 2016\n",
    "    - They are very correlated: the mortgage interest rate seems to be 1.5 percent points above the bond interest rate\n",
    "    - Why?\n",
    "        - Because although mortgages are for 30 years, they end up being paid beforehand\n",
    "        - So the banks follow the bond interest rate and add an offset\n",
    "        - The spread/offset of 1.5 is because mortgages are riskier and have more costs associated: letters, follow ups, people who don't pay or miss payings, etc.\n",
    "    - Interesting point: in the 1980s the interest rates went up to 19%!!\n",
    "        - Inflation was very high\n",
    "        - Those interest rates are almpost imposible to pay, so some special regulations and payment methods appeared\n",
    "        - As a consequence, home prices decreased, because nobody could afford paying one, so there was no demand\n",
    "        - It seems that inflation is a major cause for high interest rates: money depreciates, previously given fixed-interest mortgages are bad for banks (money had more value, thus interest rates were lower), thus, banks need to increase interest rates\n",
    "        - That is probably the reason why banks then to follow the 10-year bond interest rates\n",
    "- Types of mortages\n",

    "- Shiller shows a diagram from his book Irrational Exuberance: Home prices, Building costs, Population, Interest rates\n",
    "    - In the 2000s home prices went up very much, and although population also increased, that increase was much lower; so, we can see there was clearly a speculative bubble in real estate\n",
    "    - The Building cost decreased since 1980s and is more or less stable now; it might vary due to labour cost, but the technology is better, more efficient, which balances the price\n",
    "    - The bubble was originated by mortgages that were sold too easily, and people thought the price would go up without end\n",
    "    - Then, home prices crashed until 2012, and then it started to go up again\n",
    "    - That happened in the US and in many other countries in the world\n",

    "    - When home prices drop, agreement drops also\n",

    "- Another diagram that explains the bubble: annualized expected 10-year appreciation & 30-year mortgage rate\n",
    "    - People though their houeses would appreciate 12% every year in 2004, whereas mortgage rates were around 6%\n",
    "    - Clearly, everybody though it was stupid not to buy a house!\n",
    "    - So everybody was buying houses...\n",

    "    - When they burst, not always the market disappears completely, like with bursting bubbles, but the market might recover an even burst again!\n",
    "    - The 2008 bubble/crisis was special because the housing market bubble was everywhere, not only in EEUU, also in Spain, Italy, etc.\n",
    "        - Shiller thinks maybe the efficient markets theory influenced it too: Politicians believed in it, so all prices were correct, and nobody waged to speak out publicly the insanity of the prices\n",
