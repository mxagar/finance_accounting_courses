    "    - Historically has been like that\n",
    "    - Interestingly, central banks have started recessions inverting the yield curve\n",
    "        - They put short-term interests high and the curve inverts\n",
    "        - They have done that when inflation has started to increase too much\n",
    "        - With a recession the inflation goes down\n",
    "        - The have done that out of desperation\n",
    "- Stock markets are also a leading indicator of depression\n",

    "### Mortgages\n",
    "- In USA (2016) statistics\n",
    "    - 13.2T USD debt\n",
    "    - 48 million mortgaged homes, 10.3 underwater after the crisis: in 2012 the housing market bottomed: the value of the home was less than the value of the mortgage\n",
    "        - That caused the whole economy to go down, because people had negative earnings and stopped spending and investing\n",
    "        - That was so especially for the young home owners, who had basically their home, nothing else\n",
    "- In 1920s it was usual to have 5-year term loans (now, we have typically 30 years), so after 5 years the mortgage needed to be re-negotiated\n",
    "    - Many houeses were foreclosed after the 1929 crash, because people lost their jobs and couldn't re-negotiate their mortgages\n",
    "    - Roosevelt changed that in 1934\n",
    "        - They state took the risk using tax-payer money\n",
    "        - 15-year terms became standard\n",
    "- When prices drop a lot, usually the chance of going up is higher: mean regression\n",
    "    - In some places, house price become lower than the construction cost; that means no more houses are built there\n",
    "    - If we know that the place is going to be re-populated and life is going to go back to the normal there, it's a good investment to buy a cheap house there, when the prices are below the construction cost\n",
    "- The interest rate of 30-year term mortgages and 10-year bond insterest rates are shwon in a graph from 1965 to 2016\n",
    "    - They are very correlated: the mortgage interest rate seems to be 1.5 percent points above the bond interest rate\n",
    "    - Why?\n",
    "        - Because although mortgages are for 30 years, they end up being paid beforehand\n",
    "        - So the banks follow the bond interest rate and add an offset\n",
    "        - The spread/offset of 1.5 is because mortgages are riskier and have more costs associated: letters, follow ups, people who don't pay or miss payings, etc.\n",
    "    - Interesting point: in the 1980s the interest rates went up to 19%!!\n",
    "        - Inflation was very high\n",
    "        - Those interest rates are almpost imposible to pay, so some special regulations and payment methods appeared\n",
    "        - As a consequence, home prices decreased, because nobody could afford paying one, so there was no demand\n",
    "        - It seems that inflation is a major cause for high interest rates: money depreciates, previously given fixed-interest mortgages are bad for banks (money had more value, thus interest rates were lower), thus, banks need to increase interest rates\n",
    "        - That is probably the reason why banks then to follow the 10-year bond interest rates\n",
    "- Types of mortages\n",
    "    - Convetional: fixed rate\n",
    "        - These are the best if the inflation becomes high\n",
    "        - Shiller thinks there is going to be high inflation somewhen again\n",
    "        - Now, we have virtually no inflation\n",
