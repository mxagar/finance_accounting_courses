    "- In USA (2016) statistics\n",
    "    - 13.2T USD debt\n",
    "    - 48 million mortgaged homes, 10.3 underwater after the crisis: in 2012 the housing market bottomed: the value of the home was less than the value of the mortgage\n",
    "        - That caused the whole economy to go down, because people had negative earnings and stopped spending and investing\n",
    "        - That was so especially for the young home owners, who had basically their home, nothing else\n",
    "- In 1920s it was usual to have 5-year term loans (now, we have typically 30 years), so after 5 years the mortgage needed to be re-negotiated\n",
    "    - Many houeses were foreclosed after the 1929 crash, because people lost their jobs and couldn't re-negotiate their mortgages\n",
    "    - Roosevelt changed that in 1934\n",
    "        - They state took the risk using tax-payer money: the mortgages were insured by the state; if someone didn't pay, the state could do it\n",
    "        - 15-year terms became standard\n",
    "- When prices drop a lot, usually the chance of going up is higher: mean regression\n",
    "    - In some places, house price become lower than the construction cost; that means no more houses are built there\n",
    "    - If we know that the place is going to be re-populated and life is going to go back to the normal there, it's a good investment to buy a cheap house there, when the prices are below the construction cost\n",
    "- The interest rate of 30-year term mortgages and 10-year bond insterest rates are shwon in a graph from 1965 to 2016\n",
    "    - They are very correlated: the mortgage interest rate seems to be 1.5 percent points above the bond interest rate\n",
    "    - Why?\n",
    "        - Because although mortgages are for 30 years, they end up being paid beforehand\n",
    "        - So the banks follow the bond interest rate and add an offset\n",
    "        - The spread/offset of 1.5 is because mortgages are riskier and have more costs associated: letters, follow ups, people who don't pay or miss payings, etc.\n",
    "    - Interesting point: in the 1980s the interest rates went up to 19%!!\n",
    "        - Inflation was very high\n",
    "        - Those interest rates are almpost imposible to pay, so some special regulations and payment methods appeared\n",
    "        - As a consequence, home prices decreased, because nobody could afford paying one, so there was no demand\n",
    "        - It seems that inflation is a major cause for high interest rates: money depreciates, previously given fixed-interest mortgages are bad for banks (money had more value, thus interest rates were lower), thus, banks need to increase interest rates\n",
    "        - That is probably the reason why banks then to follow the 10-year bond interest rates\n",

    "- Shiller shows a diagram from his book Irrational Exuberance: Home prices, Building costs, Population, Interest rates\n",
    "    - In the 2000s home prices went up very much, and although population also increased, that increase was much lower; so, we can see there was clearly a speculative bubble in real estate\n",
    "    - The Building cost decreased since 1980s and is more or less stable now; it might vary due to labour cost, but the technology is better, more efficient, which balances the price\n",
    "    - The bubble was originated by mortgages that were sold too easily, and people thought the price would go up without end\n",
    "    - Then, home prices crashed until 2012, and then it started to go up again\n",
    "    - That happened in the US and in many other countries in the world\n",

    "    - Clearly, everybody though it was stupid not to buy a house!\n",
    "    - So everybody was buying houses...\n",

    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "The assigned text contains the message from Leilani Farha, Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing of the United Nations, who addresses to the members of the Human Rights Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Farha summarises several general points concerning housing affairs worldwide and, additionally, she reports insights and recommendations related to her visits to India and Portugal.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as the global situation is concerned, Ms. Farha warns of an alarming financialization of housing. Real estate represents already the 60% of all global assets as many metropolitan cities have allowed foreign investors to acquire houses as mere financial assets; as a consequence, housing prices have increased more than the incomes of the local residents in numerous places. That leads to relocations and community dismembering, to increased wealth and right inequality, and, in many situations, to foreclosures and evictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although some restrictions and taxations are being already applied, Ms. Farha urges states to strongly commit to the New Urban Agenda, which has the goal of homelessness eradication by 2030; she exhorts them to shift the policies and regulations around housing towards a more humane paradigm in which houses represent their original meaning, a living space, and a human right that cannot be abolished by avoidable evictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning the state visits, Ms. Farha describes two very distinct countries that nonetheless have fundamental challenges related to housing affairs: India and Portugal. On one hand, India has a growing population of 1.3 billion citizens and sixty million households in it lack of adequate water, electricity and sanitation conditions. Along these lines, Ms. Farha recommends a national moratorium on forced evictions and the recognition and in-situ rehabilitation of informal slums.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Ms. Farha describes Portugal as one of the most unequal countries in Europe. She reports the exclusion that African descents and the general housing unaffordability, among others, due to touristification (particularly in Lisbon and Porto).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commentary**\n",
    "\n",
    "Real estate as a mere investment vehicle, and especially a globalised real estate market in which foreign investors can freely acquire houses, can lead to many social problems. More so in our inter-connected and quickly evolving society. Unfortunately, unforeseen paths and activities might emerge from apparently positive new technologies, which end up negatively affecting many citizens due to outdated regulations that do not protect them from those unforeseen activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A clear example are social media platforms and their large scale effects in how we interact as humans. And the particular case for housing is the platform Airbnb. Airbnb is undoubtedly a great technological innovation: I rent my spare room to occasional guests that visit my city due to professional and private reasons. Airbnb was one of the major triggerers of the shared-economy and created an apparently win-win scenario. However, in many touristic cities in Spain the wealthiest home-owners monetised their unused real estates assets and rented them exclusively in the summer season; as a consequence, the offer of regular rents decreased, which lead to the increment of the monthly fees for the regular tenants. On top of that, that regulation loophole represented only advantages for the wealthiest: they had full access to their apartments, no contracts were needed, the places were only half of the year occupied and used, and probably more money than with regular rents was earned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb is not inherently bad. In fact, we desperately need such innovations as Airbnb to propel our prosperity, and in a related manner, real estate is a positive and useful mean to storing value for many investors. On the other hand, regulations clearly protect us all, but they have always been slower than technological innovations. Regulations could be understood as the delayed reaction to damaging imbalances caused by novel ways of organising our activities. And perhaps there we have part of the key: we need to embed in the technological innovations the seed for the regulation to reduce that delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several financial innovations and regulations have appeared in the field of real state, such as insurance or strict mortgage lending requirements to prevent damaging situations; some of them were and are still controversial. As it is done in many engineering fields, we could require a thorough risk analysis to every new technology and business which might have large scale impacts on fundamental rights such as housing. That additional burden would be strongly debated, but it would be in line with the stress tests required to companies and financial institutions after the 2007/8 crisis. Reflecting on the possible risks and their mitigations could make the regulator and the society aware of negative impacts and solutions."
