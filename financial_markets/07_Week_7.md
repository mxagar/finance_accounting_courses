Coursera, Yale.
Prof. Robert Shiller.

## Lesson 17: Nonprofits, Cooperatives, Philantropy

### Nonprofits, Cooperatives, Philantropy
- Traditional economic theory considers businesses want to create profits for individual use
- However, there are some other models in which profits are not the goal, eg, nonprofits
- In 2013 there were 1.4 million nonprofits in the USA, approx 10% of total workforce
    - Some people work there for nothing, eg., retired people
    - In developed countries, the percentage is also around 10%
        - Shiller thinks it's because of civil society
- Nonprofits don't give backprofits as dividends, but they need to reinvest them
- Some years ago, philantropy was a means of financing science, for instance Darwin's voyages and research were funded like that
- Nonprofits have to compete with for-profits
    - They also have salaries, bonuses, etc.
- Yale University is a nonprofit
- Other examples: hospitals
    - Usually, nonprofits have some moral goal, like provide health services independently of income
- Hoarding instinct: tendency of human beings to collect many things
    - I don't understand why this is mentioned
- Political correctness: entrepeneurs nowadays don't want to confine to the politically correct, for instance do not hire talented people to avoid seemingly unfair salary distributions.

### Cooperatives
- Business that might distribute profits
    - One person has one vote, regardless of how many shares the person holds
    - People with very little money have the same power as other with more money
    - Profits are distributed to the peope who shop there; so there is some sense of loyalty, they don't want to fool people
- Rochdale society (grocery store from UK) was the first cooperative, from 1844
- Which would be differences in busines strategy between a normal for-profit and a cooperative?
    - Usually, the incentive of the cooperative is the good for the consumer
    - Cooperatives have a community spirit
    - They tend not to be very successful in the USA
    - They have either lower wages or higher prices
    - The cooperatives are designed for their members: they sell to their members
    - The members have equal vote
    - Members usually decide to maximize the wellfare of th egroup, not that much the profit for the group


### Alternative Forms
- Alternative to nonprofits and cooperatives: Benefit Corporations
- Created in 2010 in the USA, currently spreading
    - It might become a success type of organization
- Halfway between for-profit and a non-profit
- Dual objective: for-profits and for some social or environmental purpose
    - The purpose is written in their charter (constitution)
- The spirit is different than in a regular for-profit, people do things because they are the correct things to do and aligned with the mission of the company

### Public vs. Private
- Typically education is government run
- Governments handle usually sensitive human-related issues
- Government-run companies might be corrupt, but in another way than stealing money (as in for-profit ones)
- Note: public companies are in USA companies listed on exchanges, private companies are usually smaller companies which are not listed in exchanges, but their shares are held by less people provately.
- Before medicine regulations, no tests were required before selling them
    - Anything could be sold
    - The consumers could sue the medicine producers if the had damages, but if that didn't happen, the medicines could continue to be sold
    - That caused a lot of medicines to be fake!


## Lesson 18: Critics and Perspectives on Finance
Finding your purpose in a world of financial capitalism.

### Critics of Modern Finance
- Adair Turner's book: Between Debt and the Devil
    - GDP is increasing, but so is the debt; so it seems many things are leveraged
    - Turner: Corporate debt is a kind of economic polltion that needs to be taxed
- Rana Farooha's book: Makers & Takers
    - In her book, he starts talking about Apple and Steve Jobs
    - After Jobs died, Apple started borrowing money; they already had accumulated a lot of monay under Jobs
    - She argues the strategy is tax evasion: they borrow money for tax evasion
    - She links exploitation of tax law with loss of creativity in a business
    - She argues the world is increasingly run by takers instead of makers

### Democratization of Finance
- Shiller's book: Finance and the Good Society
    - Internet could be a catalizer for democratization of finance
    - Finance tools should be available to everybody, not only wealthy people
    - One example of democratization of finance thanks to the internet: crowdfunding
        - People can publish ideas and raise money online
        - Crowdcube
        - Shiller thinks crowdfunding is a great innovation
        - In the USA, the regulators are usually more skeptical than, say, in UK, with these kind of platforms
        - In the USA, the amount of money that can be raised in crowdfunding campaings is limited: 1 million USA over 12 months
- Shiller thinks finance regulation is indeed very complicated, because the world is getting more complex and many exploitation cases need to be foreseen to avoid damages to regular citizens
- For Shiller, finances is not about getting rich, but to make civilization work better
- A fundamental thing is to show people how to take risks
    - In China and Russia there has been a total change in th elast 30 years
    - People have been exposed to financial education and they are now way more entrepeneurial and risk taking
- Democratization of finance is essential
    - 200 years ago there were no retail saving accounts
    - Savings banks were nonprofits
    - Now, things have changed a lot: everyone has a savings account!
    - Many things can change in the coming years, similarly
- Financial literacy is key for the democratization of finance
    - Shiller compares financial literacy with medical/health literacy
    - You need a doctor, but knowing about health matters and is very useful, eg., eating habits, etc.
- In the conversation, the book "Nudge" by Thaler ans Sunstein is mentioned
    - Nudge theory proposes positive reinforcement in indirect suggestions as ways to influence behavior and decision making; example: housefly in urinal

### Finance and War
- War is a perennial feature of human species, as for chimpanzees; we're always close to war, it's probably something in our genes
- There is no world government, there probably won't be such thing
- Governements get destroyed, changed, funded
- Finance often survives changes in government; example: WWI
    - Other countries thought Gemrany should pay their crimes in WWI
    - Other countries demanded reparations
    - German government planed to increase taxes to pay the victors in the war
    - However, taxes were cancelled, victors cancelled the debt after seeing how hostile Germanb people were becoming for the injustice
    - In WWII the lesson was already learned: you cannot penalize individuals for the sinns of their governments
        - But that happened in West Germany
        - In East Germany, the comunists took over and they actually grabbed things from the German
        - After the reunification, people sometimes could reclaim their lost property
- Another example of how finance survives government changes: Iran Revolution in 1979
    - Isalamists took over the governement of the shah, but they left the pensions of the previous goverment employees be
- Another example: South Africa in 1994: pensions and insurances of previous governement employees were maintained
- However, it is not always like that: socialist take overs often confiscate property and these are not returned
    - Examples: Lenin, Mao Tse-Tung, ...
    - Example: Japan after WWII: USA forced the big four (zaibatsu: Mitsubishi Mitsui, Sumitomo, Yasuda) to sell their assets and invest ni nominal yen bonds
        - As a result, there was very high inflation in Japan
- If we are doing long-term investments, we need to take into account these kind of scenarios: war, confiscation, survival of investments, etc.
    - Ultimately, the civil society will decide if our investment survives or not

### Finance and Population Growth
- Malthusiam Principle (Thomas Malthus, 1789): An Essay on the Principle of Population
    - Main point: Population naturally increases in geometric ratio whereas the subsistence of man increases in arithmetic ratio
    - So, one could undertsand that civilizations are continuously under a situation of starvation, if we do something to alleviate that situation, we reproduce, and the population meets the measures taken before, so the situation continues; it is hopeless and descouraging
    - Shiller thinks Malthus point might be true in a century-long perspective, but we live here and now, and we have the moral obligation to improve our conditions

### The Importance of Financial Theory
- The behavioral finance is very important, but we cannot forget the traditional mathematical finance, which is extremely important and has shaped our world
    - Basic financial theory is essential
    - Scarce resource allocation theories are very important
- Shiller compares the traditional mathematical finance theory to the Newtonian theories
    - Newton could explain how planets move, but not how smaller object move in our planet, because there was no model for friction
    - In a similar way, behavioral finance was the salvation for traditional mathematical finance, because it showed the frictions that inhibit it
    - Psychological factors are essential to understand our financial world
    - Similarly, law schools are also essential; Shiller neglected them at the beginnig of his career, but not anymore
        - Law schools operate in the real world, very down to earth

### Wealth and Poverty
- People are more concerned about inequality
- States were jobs were lost due to autmatization or globalization, tend to be most polarized in politics
- Shiller explains a situation
    - A factory decides to build a plant somewhere because they have cheap labour there
    - People go and start living and working there
    - Some make the mistake of buying a house there
    - Then, the company decides to move the factory somewhere cheaper
    - So people loose their jobs and their homes, because homes are worth nothing anymore when the factory leaves
    - Someone should have told those people that it would have been better not taking the risk of buying a house and renting instead!
    - In the USA, you can deduct financial advisors from the taxes, but that's used only by rich people, poor people are not aware of it, and they don't buy financial advise because it's expensive
    - So it's a subsidy for rich people!
- Poverty is in many situations due to unmanaged risk
    - Solution: make risk management better
- People accumulate wealth during their life and they die; why accumulate without sharing it?
- There are societies which do not try to accumulate so much wealth; other societies tend to do that though, and in them, there is more wealth, but also more inequality
    - However, inequality is most important in societies where people are close to the starvation

### Your Career in Finance
- The course is to understand how finance works; Shiller does not expect the attendees to become finance people
- The goal should be to accumulate wealth while young and then give it away when older; example: Gates Foundation
    - The pledge by the Gates Foundation is to give away constructively half of what we earn before we are too old
- Financial booms and crashes will be bigger in the coming years 
    - FSB: Financial Stability Board tries to approach that, but it's not possible to solve that, because it is caused by endemic 
- Our generation might live very long, and the generation of our descendants even longer
    - We underestimate what can happen in a long time
    - Look at the past 70 years: so many good and bad things have happened
    - We tend to think things are not going to change, but that is not true: we have the illusion of invulnerability
- Fooled by Randomness, by Taleb: book recommended by Shiller
- Shiller encourages to keep human capital and a broad perspective for humanity than only for ourselves
    - Human capital: skills that might be useful in the future
