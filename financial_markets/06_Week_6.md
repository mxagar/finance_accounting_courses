## Lesson 14: Investment Banks, ETFs, Mutual Funds

### Investment Banks Introduction
- Investment banks and money managers and their influences
- Commercial banks take deposits and make loans
- Investment banks don't accept deposits and don't make loans, but they underwrite securities
    - Companies go to investment banks when they need money
    - Investment banks issue new shares for those companies or issue debt: that is underwriting securities
    - Bulge-bracket firms (big firms): First Boston, Goldman Sachs (since the 2008 crisis it's a commercial bank), Merril Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers (bankrupt after 2008)
- Finance is about making things happen: you need finance to do or build good things
    - Shiller sees investment very positively, although people distrust investment banks
    - Shiller thinks the large economical growth we've seen is due to financial capitalism

### Underwriting Securities
- Underwriting securities = issuance of shares and corporate debt
- Investment banks have researchers and know where the money is; in that sense, companies could get advise from them
- If we want to issue new shares, investment banks examine us and certify the issue
- Moral Hazard problem mitigated by investment banks
    - Firms might want to issue new shares when they know that the high earnings are only temporarily high
    - Investment banks deal with those types of issues
    - Studies show that investment banks that repeatedly underprice or overprice issues suffer a market share loss afterwards
        - Low price is bad for the company
        - High price is bad for the new investors
- Investment banks have many contacts and are necessary for issuing new shares; they are like an authority, without them, people won't trust you
- The underwriting process
    - There are several phases
    - It is based on trust; many people in each step don't read really all the documents
    - If after issuing the price falls, the underwriter investment bank buys shares at the initial price: that's called stabilization, SEC agrees with it (it's not considered manipulation)
    - Stabilization is done to prevent panicking and to deal with reputation issues

### Initial Public Offerings = IPOs
- A company can trade shares privately
- If they go public, they need to do it through the SEC and prepare an IPO
- The SEC does not evalkuate if the shares are going to be sold; the SEC evaluates that there is no manipulation
- Usually the price increases after the IPO: the underwriter underprices the shares - but the SEC does not intervine
    - It is actually a manipulation, because the friends of the company get the shares cheaper
    - That is how the world works
    - Often, after the first day 15% increase can be observed; BUT: it could be that in one year the company is gone too!
- The Concert analogy (Impressario hypothesis)
    - Underwriters offer cheap tickets and advertise the concert as if it were great
    - Then, the young excited people join to the concert
    - They could increase the prices, but they don't so that the young people join! 

### Goldman Sachs and John Whitehead
- Goldman Sachs was one of the most esteemed investment banks before the 2008 crisis
    - They were making a lot of money
    - Everything was done for money
    - People are absolutely loyal to the firm
- John Whitehead has been the Chairman of Goldman Sachs; he defined some principles
    - Client's interests first
    - Assets are people, capital, reputation
    - Excellence
    - Creativity and imagination in everything done

### Rating Agencies
- An alternative to an investmenmt bank in terms of trust would be a rating agency
- A rating agency publishes its information, in contrast to an investment bank
- First rating agency: Mooddy's (1909); he decided to give ratings like at school
    - Best rating is AAA
    - Rating agencies did not accept money at the begining; but in the 1970 they started charging
    - They still accept money for their ratings, but that is unethical and it should be regulated and banned!
    - It turned out they became a great business, especially when derivatives appeared
    - In the early 2000s the rating agencies were getting casual and unprofessional; that was one of the causes of the 2008 crisis: they gave good marks to bad companies/mortgages
    - Now they have lost their reputation, but they still continue, and they are more carefully observed

### Glass Steagall Act 1933
- One of the most important acts in the congress
- First insurance of commencial banks deposits was created
- People thought that the 1929 crash was related to bank missbehavior
- The Glass Steagall act prohibited to be both commercial and investment banks
- Other countries (Germany, Switzerland) have always alllowed the so-called universal banks
- Since 1999 with Clinton, the Glass Steagall is not active anymore and banks can be universal
- There have been large merges of banks in the last 20 years
- Paul Volcker, a previous Fed Chairman wants to activate the Glass Steagall act again
    - Volcker is famous for cutting the inflation in the 70s with a recession


### Net Worth of the USA
- Total assets in USA (what is owned): 101 Trillion
    - Average person owns: 270k!
    - The average family would own 1 million dollar!
    - However, that wealth is not uniformly distributed
    - Real estate: 25 T
    - Pension funds: 21 T
    - Non-corporate equity (non-traded stocks/shares): 11 T
    - Deposits: 10 T
    - Corporate equity (traded stocks): 13 T
    - Mutual funds (indirect posesion of stocks and bonds): 8 T
    - Treasury securities (bonds): 1.2 T
    - Municipal bonds (regional government bonds): 1.5 T 
    - Life insurance: 1.3 T
- Total liabilities (what is owed): 14.5 Trillion
    - Home mortgages: 10 T
    - Consumer credit: 3.5 T
    - Loans: 1.5 T
    - Difference Assets - Liabilities: 87 T

### The Prudent Person
- ERISA: Empoyment Retirees Income Security Act (1974)
- This act defines how a prudent person would behave and asks financial managers to behave like that; basically, ask yourself what other people would do
- Similar acts have appeared since

### Advisors
- Financial advisors
    - Excluded: profesors, broker dealers, lawyers, reporters, etc.
    - Advisors are any who advide qhere to invest, also analysts
    - Financial advisors are regulated
- Financial planners
    - It's not regulated
    - They are certified
    - They do life-long financial planning
- What should we be looking for when looking for a financial advisor
    - Talk to other people who have them and ask for refeerals
    - There are associations of financial advisors, maybe contact them
    - Machines seem to be replacing financial advisors
        - Shiller thinks though, that persons are not going to be replaced completely, because of a basic human trait: we want to have some kind of personal relation
        - One problem of financial advise is that it's expensive; Shiller thinks there should be government subsidies for financial advisors, or philantropic support
    - Low-income people need financial advise, because they are atargeted with false information, for instance, to buy a house witha mortgage
        - It's not that they need stock portfolio management, but they need some coaching, like a therapist, to know how to save for the future
    - Shiller thinks it's a good idea to have some philantropic buros where people go and ask for free

### Mutual Funds and ETFs (Exchange Trade Funds)
- Mutual Funds were invented in Holland in th 1770s, like many financial things
- One of the pioneers in USA was the Massachusets Investment Trust (MIT, but no connection to the MIT university)
    - They published their portfolio, in contrast to whatÂ´s done today in 1920
    - They only had one class of investors or shares; many contemporary funds were playing tricks with class A & B shares
    - They redeemed on demand: the investors could get their money whenever they wanted!
    - MIT became the model for funds and investment management
    - In the 1930s and 1940s everything was formally regulated
- Mutual Funds: what are they and how do they work
    - You contact the investment company and give a cheque with the money
    - You don't buy shares, they do it for you
    - They have a portfolio of shares
    - When you give them money, you end up having a share of that portfolio, after subtracting the expenses (fees, salaries, etc.)
    - When can call them and tell them we want to sell our share whenever we want to exit ang get our money
    - They operate with closing prices: the closing (4 pm) prices of cheque in or exit is used
- ETF = Exchange Trade Fund
    - Something similar to the mutual funds
    - Invented in the 1990s
        - First ETF: Standard & Poor Depositary Receipts: they had a S&P500 portfolio
    - They are more liquid than mutual funds, lower costs
    - Mutual funds are called open-end funds
        - Closed-end funds are something different: you buy your share on the fund, but you can't redeem them from the fund, you need to sell them in a market
        - The advantage of closed-end funds is that they are traded all the time on the market, not at 4 pm at the Mutual Fund
        - However, the price of the closed-fund share is not tied to the value of the assets hold by the fund! May the price of the share is lower than the assets, because they have a bad management and people don't trust them!
    - The ETFs wre created as an alternative for open-end (= mutual funds) and closed-end funds
    - The idea is you have
        - Like an  open-end fund
        - You can sell whenever you want because it is traded on a exchange (not only a at 4 pm at the Mutual Fund company), so immediately redeemable
        - The fund tracks the value of the underlying assets
    - ETFs are groups of company shares that have the certificate of being traded in the ETF basket
        - The ETF itself has a share value, which follows the prices of the underlying assets, but it sometimes deviates a little bit
        - We say the ETF is trading at a discount, when its price is lower than the assets
        - At premium, when price of ETF higher than the assets
        - The difference between ETF price and asset price is used to sell back asset share to the investors or buy more asset shares; that process keeps the ETF price tied or tracking to the asset price!
        - So ETFs achieve automatic creation and redemption of shares
    - A lot of people own stocks through ETFs now
    - ETFs have a very low management fee
    - ETFs are tipically for smart investors 

## Lesson 15: Brokers, Trading

### Brokers and Dealers
- A broker is someone who acts on behalf of another one, agent which can earn a comission
- A dealer always acts for himself; if contact a dealer, the dealer owns the stocks and he sells them to us at a price, there is no comission; we can sell to a dealer
    - It is analogous to an antique dealer
    - The dealers usually have higher costs, that's why often it's more expensive treating with them
- A broker-dealer is a firm doing business both as broker and as dealer; it must be registered
    - A person cannot be both, broker and dealer, on the same transaction
- When we want to buy a home we treat with a real estate broker
    - There are dealers, but it's uncommon, probably due to taxes
    - In Germany: Immobilienmakler
- Good and bad broker behavior
    - Brokers can call the client to inform on new opportunities
    - However, we cannot forget their goal is to make a comission
    - It is illegal to make too many transactions that yield more comissions; that's called churning
    - One way to avoid uncontrolled transactions by brokers (churning) is to have full control over our portfolio

### Exchanges
- First stock exchange in the USA: New York Stock Exchange, NYSE, 1791
- NASDAQ: 1971; computerized market
    - Pink sheets were replaced
        - These were bid & ask quotes 
    - NYSE investigated the companies before incorporating them to the market
- NYSE has the most prestige, but it's fading, because NASDAQ has power too
- Exchanges must be registered
- Exchanges flourished as information technologies advanced more
- Companies choose where to list on
    - In China for instance (and in other places), people tend to invest in local exchanges because there's a familiarity bias: people hear about them, they see people

### Limit Order Book
- Island ECN was the first exchange to show its book on the web in 2002; anyone could register and play in the platform
    - Since there were many ordinary traders, ask and bid values were small
- NASDAQ started to do the same; but they required professional investors, so the registration price was/is higher and the volumes too
- The ask/bid proces and volumes are the limit order book

### High Frequency Trading
- Computer programs trade algorithmically
- These trades are so fast that human beings do not see them
- The speed of the algorithms becomes relevant; the limit is the speed of light; the distance to the data source starts to matter, because the data transmission time becomes an advantage/disadvantage
- People are concerned with high frequency trading, because it works faster than humans, and there is not human-feasible control over it
- Shiller thinks it is probably not that worrysome if you don't trade a lot, but
    - It has been shown that high frequency trading sucks a lot of money
    - Some proposals suggest grouping millisecond trades before execution and wait X seconds
    - Shiller thinks millisecond tradinhg does not add value to the market; but people are installing fiber optic cable to the data sources so that they have millisecond advantage for their algorithms
    - Fiber optic short cuts are unnecessary investments that we could avoid by gripuing trades and waiting 1-10 seconds before execution
    - Therefore, regulations are likely to appear in that respect; these don't need to come from the government, maybe they come from the exchanges

### Payment for Order Flow
- Peculiar practice
- We ask a broker to execute an action (buy/sell a stock/share)
- The brokers do not execute the order directly, but they hand it to another person
- That other person collects the orders and executes thems according to several policies
    - For instance, when a big order needs to be executed, often it is chopped into smaller orders which are executed along the time
    - That prevents big effects on the price
- That creates an extra fee for the investor
- The final executor could also be a high frequency trader
- The SEC investigated that pratice and decided to not outlaw it
    - They decided it was too complex to ban it, the consequences were unknown
    - The response was to regulate some transparency: the broker needed to publish there whereabouts of the executor, some quality metrics (did they really get the best price?)

### Kinds or Orders
- Market order
    - Typical for retail investors
    - The broker supposedly gets the best market price
- Limit order
    - I want to buy below a price or sell above a price
    - We expect that small price fluctuations will happen, so we minimize risk
    - Some years ago there was a mini instantaneous crash in the markets and people who had market orders sold at very low prices; clearly, limit orders are much safer than market orders if we leave them automatized
- Stop loss order
    - I will sell at any price at or below a threshold
    - This is a security in case the price falls below a certain point

## Lesson 16: Public Finance

### Government Debt - Public Finance
- Government default
    - Government debt default: it does not mean the government is not going to pay its debts
    - Governemnt debt repudiation: that means the government is not going to pay its debts; the communist countries (Soviet Union) did that
    - Odious debt: when a new government is created and it repudiates the previous one and says they're not going to pay the debts of the previous corrupt government; that is very seldom
    - Greece defaulted in 2015, but some of its debt
        - Austerity measures were taken to pay the debt
        - When a country in debt is at least paying interests on it, the debt lender typically agrees some discounts, because they are aware of the difficulty of the situation
    - There is no international court of law when a country is not paying its debt
        - But it's a really bad reputation
        - Investors would stop investing in that country forever
        - When there are paying issues, negotiations start between countries and usually debt amount is decreased
- Percentage of countries that have defaulted since 1800 (Reinhart-Rogoff)
    - Diagram shown
    - Percentage moves all the time from 10% to 45%; so it's very common for countries to default!
    - The curve looks like a cycle, not that its periodic, but it shouldn't be surprising if we see new defaults
    - These apparent cycle last 30 years approximately

### Government Involvement in Corporations
- The USA is the most capitalistic governemnt in the world, but it does not mean that there's no involvemenmt
- Governments can even own corporate shares; although that's not common in the USA
- Who pays for Fikushima disaster?
    - TEPCO, the company behind the disaster, is now owned in a big part (> 50%) by the government
    - That is normal, because if TEPCO had to pay all the consequences it would have gone bankrupt (it's the 4th largest  electric power company in the world) and no one would have paid it
- When a company is in abig trouble, it can file for bakruptcy
    - Bankruptcy laws regulate that
    - Liquidation: when situation is so bad that everythong is closed and sold, and debts are paid (if it is enough) with the aquired money
        - Usually, the money is not eneough and the shareholders don't get anything
    - Reorganization: that happens when the situation is not as bad, and the company has some value yet; General Motors is an example of that
- Personal bankruptcy
    - Similar to corporate bankruptcy
    - A person can file for it

### Municipal Finance
- State governments are independent; recall the USA began as the European Union, several collonies that later formed an union
- Why do city governments have debt? Couldn't they get money from taxes?
    - The point is that cities need to build infrastructure to maintain and attract people
    - If they build expensive infrastructure by expensive taxes of few citizens to attract new people, that's unfair
    - Basically cities make the business of attrackting people, they borrow money for that
    - Examples of finacing: new roads, sewage, schools, etc.
- Connecticut is a state that has a prohibition against deficit spending, which means, higher taxes for higher income braquets
    - However, note that prohibition against deficit spending does not mean cities cannot spend if they have debt
    - Cities have two accounts
        - Current account: salaries, taxes
        - Capital account: investments, like building a school
    - If the capital account is in debt but the current not, then, they can still spend; the prohibition works if the current account is in debt
- Revenue bonds
    - The city/state can build a road or a bridge and ask for a toll on it
    - The city extends bonds to finance the project
    - The money from the toll is used to pay back the bonds

### Government Social Insurance
- 1870, Germany invented some important social insurances under Otto von Bismark
    - Krankenversicherung
    - Unfallversicherung
    - Altersversicherung
- Germans didn't invent the unemployment insurance: that were the English in 1911
- Previously, the Church was in charge of all these insurance functions with charity
    - Clearly, a state handled insurance system make much more sense
- Unless unemployment insurance (until now), all other insurance have been handled privately
- Progressive taxes are a reasonable tool: if you income falls very low, your taxes are lower too; in the USA an in other countries, there are also negative taxes for very low incomes
- USA has
    - Free public education, which is an incredible achievement: even the poorer can get a decent education
    - Social security: old age, survivors, disabled
    - Health insurance: Medicare, Medicaid - the USA is the only developed country without comprehensive health insurance
    - Workers compensation: for protecting people from job-related hazards; it started in Germany (Arbeitsversicherung): the company pays the insurance against accidents at the workplace
- Income tax
    - At the begining, during the USA Civil War,  it didn't work, because they couldn't verify the income of the people
- Withholding of the Income Taxes
    - Another invention
- Survivor insurance
    - Created in 1939
    - It's like a life insurance; when they created it, they didn't call it like that to avoid the protests or oposition of life insurance companies
