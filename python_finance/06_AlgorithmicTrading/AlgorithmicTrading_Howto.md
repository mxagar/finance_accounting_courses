# Algorithmic Trading

This document summarizes the last two sections of the Udemy course by Jos√© Marcial Portilla

**Python for Financial Analysis and Algorithmic Trading**

The videos of the original course explain how to perform backtests with trading algorithms using Quantopian. However, Quantopian was acquired in late 2020 by Robinhood and the `zipline` servers offering the Quantopian services were shut down. Therefore, two alternatives are possible:
1. Run the backtests locally installing the `zipline` library
2. Use Blueshift instead of Quatopian; Blueshift seems to be identical, also free: https://blueshift.quantinsti.com

I have used Blueshift.

# Part 1: Basics of Algorithmic Trading

- We use an online IDE accessed through the browser.
- In the IDE, we write trading algorithms and backtest them: we run our algorithms and see how portfolios would have developed with historical data; then, it is possible to go live.
- Create account + press `Create Strategy`
