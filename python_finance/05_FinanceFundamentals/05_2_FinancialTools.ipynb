    "        - Usually high returns are targeted; they want to beat the market, r at least beat the benchmarks\n",
    "        - Only accreditred investors are allowed (you need to have a lot of money)\n",
    "        - This course is trying to emulate the tools a hedge fund coudl use to beat the market\n",
