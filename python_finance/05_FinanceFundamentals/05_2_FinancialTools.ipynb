    "- Every time we buy/sell a stock we create an **order**, whicih contains the following information\n",
    "    - Buy or sell\n",
    "    - Symbol, eg. AAPL\n",
    "    - Number of shares\n",
    "    - Limit / Market: if limit, we are willing to pay maximum/minimum a price; if market: the shares are bought/sold at market price\n",
    "    - Price (for Limit orders)\n",
    "- Every order goes to an order book in the exchange\n",
    "    - Either the orders go automatically or through a broker\n",
    "    - The book has two columns: BUY & SELL\n",
    "    - BUY column has buy orders with SHARES (number of shares) & BID (limit max price)\n",
    "    - SELL column has sell orders with SHARES (number of shares) & ASK (limit min price)\n",
    "    - BUY-SELL entries that match are executed\n",
    "- How does an order get to the exchange?\n",
    "    - Usually that happens through brokers: the investors contact brokers that buy/sell in the exchanges\n",
    "        - If the broker has clients that want the complementary action with an asset (buy/sell), they can bypass the exchanges, but they need to provide the same prices as in the exchanges\n",
    "        - Different brokers can handle also between them in dark pools, bypassing the exchanges; dark pools are opaque, but are legal. They are meaningful if large amounts are traded, to avoid affecting too much the market price\n",
    "        - Dark pools are becoming more present\n",
    "        - The brokers get a fee\n",
    "    - Another scenario are High Frequency Tradings\n",
    "        - HFT companies put their servers close to the exchanges, so they can send orders faster (eg, in 0.5 milliseconds); usual orders take around 2 ms to arrive\n",
    "        - Now, image a big company whats to buy a lot of shares: orders must be split to different eschanges due to their size\n",
    "        - As one large 2ms order arrives an exchange, a HFT company detects it and triggers the servers of other exchanges to buy fasteer than the other large orders arrive, so they have an advantage\n",
    "        - HFT is not relevant for us"
